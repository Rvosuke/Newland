It is based on the idea of representing the 3D structure of an object by breaking it down into a series of 2D planes, or \""splats,\"" and then using these splats to construct a 3D mesh. The use of Gaussian functions allows for a smooth and continuous representation of the object, which is particularly useful for rendering thin structures like hair or grass, where fine details are important. Additionally, the use of splats allows for efficient computation of the 3D representation, making it a useful technique for real-time rendering."
