# :robot: Newland AI Internship Project

## :book: Description
This repository contains the projects and code developed during my internship as an AI Algorithm Engineer at Newland. The work primarily focuses on facial recognition, large language models (LLMs), and model deployment using Python, PyTorch, and ModelScope.

## :mag: Overview
As part of my internship at Newland, I worked on various AI and machine learning projects, focusing on:
- :face_in_clouds: Facial recognition algorithms
- :brain: Large language models (LLMs), including fine-tuning and deployment
- :gear: Integration with ModelScope for efficient model usage

This repository serves as a portfolio of my work and a demonstration of the skills I've developed during this internship.
